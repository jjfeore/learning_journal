# LJ Code 201 - Day 13
*22 March 2017*

Working with localStorage today was pretty interesting. I didn't have time to do the stretch UI for the other day, but I started on it and it seems pretty challenging. I appreciate you providing them, along with the additional information for the sake of challenging myself. I don't really understand the tests at all right now, but I suppose that's the exciting thing about it. I'm looking forward to figuring it out.
