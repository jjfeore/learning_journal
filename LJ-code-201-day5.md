# LJ Code 201 - Day 5
*10 March 2017*

So far, things have moved at a pretty slow pace. That might just be me though. It's pretty clear that my previous coding and CS background is helping me with a lot of the concepts, but I also feel like most of this has just been review from Codecademy. I suppose that's just the nature of stacked module learning. I am learning a fair amount about git, github, and the terminal though, so it has still been a valuable week in that respect.

I am really looking forward to next week though. Getting to work more with the DOM ought to be fun.
