# LJ Code 201 - Day 8
*15 March 2017*

It has been a LONG time since I worked with event listeners. The last time I worked with them, CSS wasn't a thing and they were used in the body of the HTML. The most complex thing you ever saw back then was folks do highlights on hover and that sort of thing. It's real cool to see all the power that's available now, and it's has been interesting playing with the DOM. I'm excited to start work on our projects soon.
