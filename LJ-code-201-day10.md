# LJ Code 201 - Day 10
*17 March 2017*

Happy St. Patty's Day!

I really enjoyed the last couple days. CSS is certainly an area where I'm weak, and it was nice having to struggle a bit to get things to work. I really enjoyed the challenge of the chocolate pizza lab today. I'd love to see more CSS and HTML challenges over the next week. There's so much nuance to CSS that I feel like I just have to keep cracking at it to build proficiency.
