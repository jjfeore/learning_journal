# LJ Code 201 - Day 17
*27 March 2017*

It was nice working collaboratively with git for the first time. It gave me an idea of the power and flexibility of the platform, and helps me understand its use better. I enjoyed working on the project today. The entire thing went MUCH faster and more smoothly than I anticipated. If the pace keeps up, I'm looking forward to challenging ourselves with some of the stretch goals.
