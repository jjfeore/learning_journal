# LJ Code 201 - Day 19
*29 March 2017*

I felt out of gas all day today. I enjoy working collaboratively, but pair programming every line of code is just mentally exhausting. I really find that I get the most work done once I pack up and go home. Being able to sit in relative peace and knock out issues on my own seems faster. I recognize that this doesn't help my group learn as much, but the way we work during the day feels more like in-class code review than it feels like actual programming. I guess this might be the most valuable lesson of the whole exercise though: I'm getting a better feel for how I function in a team, with respect to programming, and what I need to work on.
