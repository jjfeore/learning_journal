# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

Day 1 was relatively uneventful. I don't imagine this slower pace will last very long though, so I'll just enjoy it for today.

For the most part, today was a rehash of a lot of the subjects we studied in pre-work. The HTML and Javascript stuff was definitely on the light end, but getting to spend some time working with git was useful. Reading through the Udemy tutorial on git had been almost completely worthless because I lacked any context for its use, but I was able to grasp the concepts pretty easily today.
