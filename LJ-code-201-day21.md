# LJ Code 201 - Day 20
*31 March 2017*

Not sure how my last learning journal two days ago was journal day 19, but this one is 20. I must have screwed something up.

Anyway, I've really enjoyed this course. Time permitting, I plan to spend the 201/301 interim week working on a project I discussed with a few classmates today. It's a light website that actually benefits from our more limited scope of knowledge, just because it will help keep the site even lighter and restricting storage to localStorage versus a database would be a benefit. I would love to be able to build a variety of projects that can help demonstrate a depth of experience and have some actual traction in terms of use by the time we finish 401.
