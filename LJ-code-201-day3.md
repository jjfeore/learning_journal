# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

It's nice that we're finally getting into the meat of things. The stuff we're going over is still review from the Codecademy stuff and my previous experience, but the labs are helpful challenges. I appreciate that the Day 3 lab was put up before the start of class though. Having the actual lab we're going to be working on put up ahead of time is really helpful for me. Being able to reference the lab assignment helps me contextualize what I'm learning each day.

I also really like having the stretch goals for the lab. I've been giving myself daily stretch goals with each lab, and having something to focus my efforts is nice. I'd love to see these throughout the remaining labs.
