# LJ Code 201 - Day 15
*24 March 2017*

I really enjoyed the project this week. Busmall, along with the stretch UI stuff, really helped me get a better grasp on CSS. There's definitely still a mountain of stuff to learn, but it's cool that I'm getting a better idea of all that I don't know.

If there's one thing I wish we could have had more time with, it's working collaboratively on github. I recognize that that's the point of today's lab, but it would have been nice to have a precursor lab to this. Something not involving merge conflicts perhaps, just to get comfortable with working collaboratively on a repo and all submitting different files to the same repo. It feels like we're hitting a whole new depth of git right as we go into project week.
