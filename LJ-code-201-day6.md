# LJ Code 201 - Day 6
*13 March 2017*

Today was a real step up and was much more exciting. Getting to work with the DOM and having to sink our teeth into CSS is real interesting. It was nice to start pushing my boundaries, and I'm looking forward to being overwhelmed. I can already tell that the DOM has a little bit of weirdness to it. I tried a couple approaches to listing elements on the page before settling on Nick's suggested approach. I'm a little upset I couldn't get those approaches to work, but I'll retry them in the future when I have a bit more time or I'm more familiar with the DOM.
