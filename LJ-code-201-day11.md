# LJ Code 201 - Day 11
*20 March 2017*

I really enjoyed today's assignment. It was a real thinker, and it forced me to approach the assignment one piece at a time. I was still a little shaky on my event listeners going into today, and this assignment really helped me solidify that knowledge. I haven't gotten to the stretch UI goal yet, but I plan to tackle it today (right after this) and I'm looking forward to the next several. Without knowing how the stretch UIs will be structured going forward, I'll say this: it would help a lot if each one was designed to make us get familiar with a specific CSS thing. For instance, the chocolate pizza lab really helped me understand the line-height attribute, just by virtue of trial and error. Having something like that for various different CSS attributes would be cool.
